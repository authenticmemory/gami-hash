# GAMI Hashing Tool (`gami-hash`)

A small, trustworthy tool that institutions run locally to produce checksums
for their collections. It walks a folder tree, computes SHA-256 for every
file, and writes one CSV manifest. Nothing else.

This is the only software GAMI ever asks an institution to install, so it is
built to require no support calls and to be verifiable by the institution's
IT.

## What it does

- You pick a folder and an output location, press start, watch a progress
  bar, and get a done message with an "Open folder" button for the result.
- Per file it records: `relative_path, filename, size_bytes, sha256, mtime_utc`.
  Technical metadata only, no accession numbers, no institution-specific
  logic. The relative path is what GAMI matches against the institution's
  own metadata later.
- Output is UTF-8 with BOM (so Excel displays umlauts correctly), RFC 4180
  CSV, one line per file, deterministic order.

## What it does not do

- It never writes into the scanned folder. This is enforced in code, not
  just policy: choosing an output location inside the scanned folder is
  refused.
- It never modifies, moves or deletes any file. Files are opened read-only.
- It makes no network connections. There is no networking code in the
  program at all; `go list -deps` shows no `net*` packages (see
  [docs/WHAT-THIS-TOOL-DOES.md](docs/WHAT-THIS-TOOL-DOES.md)).
- No installation, no admin rights, no configuration, no telemetry.

## Robustness (built for the archive reality)

- **Resumable, one click.** Multi-terabyte runs take hours. Interrupt any
  time (cancel button, Ctrl-C, crash, power loss). The next start offers to
  continue right away; one click picks up where it stopped. A torn CSV line
  from a hard crash is repaired automatically.
- Resume rows are reused only while path, byte size, and precise modification
  time still match. Changed files are hashed again and deleted files disappear
  from the reconstructed result. IT can force full verification with
  `--rehash-existing`.
- A file that changes while it is being read is retried once, then omitted and
  clearly reported rather than receiving an unreliable checksum.
- **Errors never abort the run.** Unreadable files, permission problems and
  vanished files are recorded in an error log next to the output file
  (`…_errors.log`) and skipped.
- **Handles the messy reality**: paths longer than 260 characters,
  UNC/network drives, umlauts, decomposed Unicode (NFD), CJK, emoji, and
  filenames in legacy encodings or with control characters (recorded
  percent-encoded so the CSV stays valid single-line UTF-8; the raw name
  goes to the error log).
- **External drives that change drive letters** between sessions are
  recognized; the resume dialog explains it and continues correctly.
- Symlinks and junctions are never followed (loop- and escape-safe); they
  are noted in the error log.
- **Parallelism** defaults to 2 workers, deliberately low: parallel reads
  make spinning disks slower through seeking. On SSDs, override with
  `-workers N` (CLI) or the `GAMI_HASH_WORKERS` environment variable (GUI).

## Usage

**GUI (for archivists):** double-click the binary. A short wizard runs:
explanation, pick folder, pick output location (defaults to the desktop),
start, progress, done. Step-by-step guide with screenshots:
[docs/ARCHIVIST-GUIDE.md](docs/ARCHIVIST-GUIDE.md).

**CLI (for IT staff / scripting):**

```
gami-hash --root FOLDER --output FILE.csv [--workers N] [--fresh] [--rehash-existing] [--quiet]
```

Exit codes: `0` done · `1` fatal error · `2` done but some files unreadable
(see error log) · `130` interrupted (resumable).

## Files it writes

| File | When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `<output>.csv` | always | the manifest (the only deliverable) |
| `<output>_errors.log` | only if problems occurred | one line per skipped or unreadable file |
| `<output>.csv.part.json` | during a run | marks an unfinished run for resume; removed on success; safe to delete |
| `last-run.json` in the user config folder | after an interruption | enables the one-click resume offer; removed on success; safe to delete |

## Building / verifying

Binaries are reproducible: the same source and the same Go toolchain produce
bit-for-bit identical files on any machine. See [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md).

```
./build.sh v1.2.0     # builds Windows/macOS/Linux + SHA256SUMS
go test -race ./...   # test suite
```

Linux and macOS downloads are packaged as `.tar.gz`/`.zip` because browsers
strip the executable permission from bare binaries; extracting restores it.

Until a code-signing certificate is in place, Windows SmartScreen will warn
on first run; institutions verify the published SHA-256 instead
(instructions in the IT one-pager).

## Alternatives for institutions (context)

This tool is option 4 of 4: (1) shipping drives to GAMI is being phased out;
(2) institutions with existing checksums (BagIt, fixity reports) just send
those; (3) institutions with IT staff can use the one-page PowerShell script
in [reference/Get-FileHashes.ps1](reference/Get-FileHashes.ps1), which
produces the identical CSV format and doubles as an independent cross-check
of this tool.
